RxJava Version 2

Name	Units of Data Produced
Observable	Multiple or None
Flowable	Multiple or None
Single	One
Maybe	One or None
Completable	None


Backpressure
Backpressure is when an Operation or Subscriber cannot process data fast enough, 
causing other work further up the Rx chain to backup.
If you are making a one off web request then you are only handling one item so an Observable would work. 
If you are doing UI work like processing UI events then you likely need to keep up to date because you donâ€™t
want to process events late and make the app appear sluggish. In those cases you likely want to have a sampling or
debouncing strategy.
